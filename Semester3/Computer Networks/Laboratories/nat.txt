Network Address Translation

=> private ip adresses are used inside the LAN  so there might be duplicates at the same time,
in case of accesing outside of LAN, the public IP adresses must be unique

=> NAT modifies source/destination IP adresses of packets
		why?
=> to allow hosts with private IP adresses to communicate with other hosts over the Internet
